## 🍃 Why Breezy CV?

- **Easy to Maintain**: Separation of content (`resume.yaml`) and design.
- **Configurable**: Choose themes (currently 'modern'), colors, and toggles via `config.yaml`.
- **Assets Managed**: Automatically handles your avatar and favicon.
- **Auto-Deploy**: Built-in GitHub Actions workflow to deploy to GitHub Pages automatically.
- **Private**: Keep your personal data in a private repo while publishing only the public site.

## 🚀 Quick Start

You don't need to fork this repo to use it. You can use it as a tool in your own private repository.

### 1. Create a Repository

Create a new empty repository on GitHub (it can be private).

### 2. Initialize

Run these commands in your local terminal:

```bash
# Create a folder for your resume
mkdir my-resume && cd my-resume

# Initialize npm
npm init -y

# Install Breezy CV
npm install github:fritzip/breezy-cv

# Initialize the project structure
npx breezy-cv init
```

This will create:

- `resume.yaml` (Your content)
- `config.yaml` (Your settings)
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (Auto-deployment script)

### 3. Customize

1.  Edit **`resume.yaml`** with your own information.
2.  Edit **`config.yaml`** to change colors or reference your photo.
    ```yaml
    avatar: "photos/me.jpg" # Place your photo in the folder and link it here
    ```

### 4. Deploy

1.  Commit and push your changes:
    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Initial commit"
    git push origin main
    ```
2.  Go to your repository on GitHub.
3.  Navigate to **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under **Build and deployment**, select **GitHub Actions** as the source.

🎉 **That's it!** Your resume will be built and deployed. Check the "Actions" tab to see the progress.
